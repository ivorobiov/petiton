## Petition: Expel Russia from FATF and add it to the Black List

On 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation declared a “special military operation” in Ukraine, which was followed by
missile strikes on Ukraine’s territory and a full-scale invasion from three directions. During the first three weeks of
Russia’s war of aggression, Russian troops have killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians and destroyed critical
infrastructure worth billions of US dollars. Some of Russian troops’ actions – such as bombardment of maternity
hospitals and taking civilians hostages – resemble terrorist acts more than conventional warfare. These appalling
actions by the Russian Federation are the aggravation of an armed conflict that Russia had started against Ukraine in
2014 with the seizure of the Crimean Peninsula, as well as parts of Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

The actions of the Russian Federation are in violation
of [Article 2(4) of the UN Charter](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-1) and a number of international
conventions. They have entailed a uniform condemnation of the international community. On 2 March, the General Assembly
of the United Nations [adopted a resolution](https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/ga12407.doc.htm) demanding that the
Russian Federation immediately end its invasion of Ukraine and unconditionally withdraw all its military forces from
Ukraine. The alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine prompted the Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Court
to [open a formal investigation](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=2022-prosecutor-statement-referrals-ukraine)
. Ukraine also applied to the International Court of Justice with the case concerning allegations of genocide under the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

Russia’s conduct was also punished with a host of unprecedented sanctions that were imposed by the members of the
international community, including the United States, the European Union, United Kingdom, Japan and Canada. Russia has
been expelled from a number of international fora, including the vote of the Parliamentary Assembly to expel Russia from
the Council of Europe on 15 March. However, one influential organization – the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – has
so far shown only a lukewarm reaction to Russia’s flagrant breaches of international law. On 4 March, FATF issued a _[
Public Statement](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfgeneral/documents/ukraine-2022.html) on the Situation in
Ukraine_. In this statement, the organization has recognised that the deeds by the Russian Federation contravene the
FATF’s core principles and represent a gross violation of the commitment upon which FATF Ministers agree to implement
and support the FATF Standards. In this statement the FATF also announced that it was “reviewing Russia’s role at the
FATF” and would “consider what future steps are necessary to uphold these core values”. However, this rhetoric was not
followed up by any meaningful action from the FATF in the past two weeks. Such inaction gives grounds to suspicions that
the FATF is following the core principles enshrined in its foundational documents. The Financial Action Task Force was
established in 1989 as a part of a comprehensive international mechanism to address the problem of illicit drugs. Since
then, it has evolved into the leading global standard-setting body for combatting money laundering, terrorist financing
and proliferation financing. Based
on [the updated Mandate](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfgeneral/documents/fatf-mandate.html) of the
organization as of 2019, the FATF is designated to protect the integrity of the financial system and enhance its
transparency, which in turn contributes towards global security. Yet, the continuing FATF membership of Russia – a
country that is undermining the global security – jeopardizes these crucial goals.

The Russian Federation has been a FATF member since 2003. As it was granted the full FATF membership, Russia took an
obligation to pursue the values, principles and mandate of the organization. However, Russia’s undeclared and unprovoked
war against Ukraine goes against these basic principles of international cooperation enshrined in the FATF Mandate.
Given that the Russian Federation has breached the principles and mandate of the FATF, the **Russian Federation should
be expelled from the organisation**. Furthermore, as Russia has now become a heavily sanctioned state, there is a
growing risk that it would act as a perpetrator of financial crime – rather than a party that contributes to combatting
it in the spirit of international cooperation. It is increasingly likely that such attempts to circumvent the sanctions
regime would jeopardize the integrity of the global financial system. One of the tasks in the FATF’s Mandate is the
following: “Identifying and engaging with high-risk, non-co-operative jurisdictions and those with strategic
deficiencies in their national regimes, and co-ordinating action to protect the integrity of the financial system
against the threat posed by them”. FATF currently lists some countries
as [High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/documents/call-for-action-february-2020.html) (
also known as a “black list”), as they exhibit “significant strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money
laundering, terrorist financing, and financing of proliferation”. Given the rapidly growing threat that Russia poses to
the integrity of the global financial system, **FATF should proactively add the Russian Federation to the list of such
High-Risk Jurisdictions**.

We hereby call for:

1. **The FATF President**: to convene additional extraordinary meeting of the FATF Plenary under the para 25 of the FATF
   Mandate, given the current circumstances and the need to provide decisive and adequate response to Russia’s violation
   of the FATF’s principle and mandate.
2. **The FATF Plenary**: to consider the expulsion of the Russian Federation from the FATF membership as guided by para
   20 (e).
3. Address the **FATF-style regional bodies** to terminate Russia’s membership (the Eurasian Group, MONEYVAL) and the
   observer status (Asia/Pacific group on Money Laundering, Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force).
4. Add the Russian Federation to the list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action.
